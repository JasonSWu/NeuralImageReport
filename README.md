# NeuralImage
1. how would you prepare the data or get the data labeled for the training? 
2. What model would you choose given that I have limited GPU resources? say a single nVidia 4090 GPU
3. how to fine tune the model?
4. how to let the model have a memory so that it can remember all my previous conversations and respond to me more intelligently.
